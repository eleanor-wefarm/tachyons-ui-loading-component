UI Loading Component to use with Tachyons CSS

Why: An attempt to put a loading indicator dead center of page using _only_ [tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons).
Ended up need to add two inline styles which was not the goal. I will try again later.

What: Meant to assure website vistors that ajax is getting their stuff. The div containing the loading indicator is fixed and covers the entire viewport and has a solid background color to obscure any page contents visable.
